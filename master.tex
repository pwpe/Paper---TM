%\color{red}{
Telehealth systems for early detection and treatment of chronic conditions have seen increased use. But the effects on user needs and concerns when healthcare provider continuously monitor and patients provide subjective and objective data over time is poorly understood. Personal Informatics literature informed the analysis of interviews with six Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients to improve understanding of user needs and concerns in the use of a state of the art telehealth solution. While patients generally felt taken care of, the system in many ways did not meet user needs, e.g. due to difficulties assessing reliable subjective measures and no support on reflection and follow-up action. Interviews, workbooks and design feedback sessions with patients served as the foundation for redesigning the system to support data collection and reflection. Findings from a two week trial involving five COPD patients showed that the system supported one of two types of patients in becoming more informed and aware about their health status, leading to increased empowerment in their everyday life and motivation to set goals and improve condition.

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
% and flushend isn't awesome, so I choose balance.  See this
% for more info: http://cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/balance.pdf
%
% Note that in a perfect world balance wants to be in the first
% column of the last page.
%
% If balance doesn't work for you, you can remove that and
% hard-code a column break into the bbl file right before you
% submit:

% http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2149854/how-to-manually-equalize-columns-
% in-an-ieee-paper-if-using-bibtex
%
% Or, just remove \balance and give up on balancing the last page.
